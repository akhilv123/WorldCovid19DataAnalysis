Now seperate the daily cases data for China using pivot tables.

Now plot the time series of daily cases.

Now, we use the inbuilt Forecast.ETS function in excel to forecast the daily cases for 3 months.

Now, we will encode the SIR model in Excel using Euler's method and a trial simulation is performed using ballpark estimates.

Now, we will estimate the SIR Model parameters using least squares fitting via Trendline in Excel.

First, the fitting is done on daily new cases data and parameters are estimated.

After that, the fitting is done on daily cumulative cases data and parameters are estimated.
